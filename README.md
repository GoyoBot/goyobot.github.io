## About this repo

This site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It builds a *static* website, so the load time for the user is blazingly fast.

Basically, every time you push something to the `master` branch, GitHub runs Jekyll on that commit and builds the static site (it may take some seconds).

- Keep the source code in English, please.



## Member info

If you are a new member, please add your personal information:

- `_data/members.yml` keeps the main organizational structure. Make sure you have a name there and the organization is correct. Keep a simple name there; it is only used as a reference.
- Given your internal name in the previous step, add a file like `_data/<member>.yml`.
- `_data/default.yml` has the default data if your user info file is missing. Use it as a template.

Store your icon file in `assets/img/members/<member>.png`.
